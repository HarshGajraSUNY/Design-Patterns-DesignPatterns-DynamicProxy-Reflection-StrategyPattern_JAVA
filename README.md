# Design-Patterns-DesignPatterns-DynamicProxy-Reflection-StrategyPattern_JAVA

The purpose of this project is to create a generic library to serialize and deserialize objects. The code should allow the conversion of objects into a wire format. The code should be designed using dynamic proxies and reflection so that addition of new objects or serialization formats causes minimal changes (reduces the ripple effect).
Creating the Dynamic Proxy
The Driver code should call the createProxy method in the ProxyCreator utility class to create a dynamic proxy reference.
Compare the objects that were serialized in writeObj to the objects that are returned from readObj. 
//Please do not copy any part of code as its an academic project .
